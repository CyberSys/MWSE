## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Changed project base from Visual Studio 2005 to Visual Studio 2017.

### Added
- New function to get the race of the player and NPCs: xGetRace.

- New function to remove all elements in an array: xClearArray

### Fixed
- Calling xSetArrayValue with an invalid array id could crash the game.

## [0.9.5-alpha.20171112] - 2017-11-12

### Fixed
- In some cases, evaluating string format codes could fail (xMessageFix,
  xStringBuild, xLogMessage, xFileWriteText).

### Added
- New function to get maximum, current (modified), and unmodified encumbrance:
  xGetEncumbrance.

  xGetMaxMagicka, xGetMaxFatigue

### Changed

  player.

  potentially causing a crash.

Original Developers: CdCooley, FreshFish

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2007-02-24 by Grant McDorman <grmcdorman>
Changed MWSE.DLL to be in Morrowind directory. When injecting the DLL, try
to find MWSE.DLL in the launcher directory and the Morrowind directory; if
the DLL differs in version, or is not present in the Morrowind directory,
copy the file from the launcher directory to the Morrowind directory. Also
fix the 'view log' to look in the Morrowind directory as well, and to detect
the absence of the log (instead of launching Notepad anyway).

## 2007-02-24 by Grant McDorman <grmcdorman>
Changed mechanism for locating MWSE.DLL in launcher, to try and squish bug
1666719.

## 2007-02-03 by Grant McDorman <grmcdorman>
Copied Ted's ArchiveMaker to trunk from 0.9.4 release tag.

Remove unneeded and confusing 'mwse 0.9.3' directory (contents moved to
parent)
Installer build script fetches Changelog.txt and binaries from their initial
locations (no copying)

## 2007-01-25 by Grant McDorman <grmcdorman>
Launcher updated to have a status bar. Messages in the status bar give:

- launcher version (when first started)
- "Morrowind started" when "Launch Morrowind" pressed
- "MWSE <version> loaded in Morrowind <version>"
- "Morrowind exited"

Also, log moved from Morrowind directory to directory containing MWSE.DLL,
and MWSE.DLL logs its version in the log file when started.

## 2007-01-24 by Grant McDorman <grmcdorman>
New launcher (formerly known as the loader). Written using WTL 8, it has
the following features:

- Buttons to launch Morrowind's launcher, view MWSE log, and exit
- Launcher does not need to be in Morrowind directory (but MWSE.dll needs to be in _launcher's_ directory)
- Does not hang or use lots of CPU when looking for Morrowind to start
- Log is once again a text file (MWSELog.txt in Morrowind directory)
- Detects Morrowind (and injects MWSE.dll) when Morrowind is launched externally
- Buttons (launch, view log) disable/enable as appropriate

## 2007-01-22 by Grant McDorman <grmcdorman>
Regular expression string match (xStringMatch). Uses Boost library.
